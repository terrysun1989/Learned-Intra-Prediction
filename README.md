# Learned-Intra-Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and pre-trained models to reproduce the following paper:

Heming Sun, Lu Yu, Jiro Katto, "Fully Neural Network Mode Based Intra Prediction of Variable Block Size," VCIP 2020 Best Paper

The implementation is based on HEVC Test Model (HM) 16.9.

## Folder

We currently support building on Windows, and the generated dynamic library tensorflow.dll is in the bin/vc2015/x64/Release, which is the default folder for the TAppEncoder/TAppDecoder.

The pre-trained models are stored in the model folder.
